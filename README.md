Assignment2 pt 1
In this updated part The web builder will allow the user to edit and delete tasks, they will also have a header that allows them to acess any part of the application from any page. I had aslo implimetned error handling as I have an error and 404 page trying to redirect you.

I am able to physically insert values into the class table but couldn't figure out how to have the user input them and have them saved to the database.
