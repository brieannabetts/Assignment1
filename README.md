Assignment2 pt 1
In this updated part The web builder will allow the user to edit and delete tasks, they will also have a header that allows them to acess any part of the application from any page. I had aslo implimetned error handling as I have an error and 404 page trying to redirect you.

I am able to physically insert values into the class table but couldn't figure out how to have the user input them and have them saved to the database.

Assignment 2 part 2

In this part I created a user login, log out and registration page. I made a validation page to make sure that the user had logged in and had rpoper credentials. And created a auth page to end sessions. I implimented some js to create a checkbox and have the checkboxes when clicked to move the task to the bottom of the page and cross it out and fade it.
